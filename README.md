# Elements-of-Data-Analytics
Projects for the cs329e course.

"What is the course objective?
Data focused problem solving has emerged as a preeminent technique to infuse computer systems with skills traditionally left to the human brains.  Making predictions about what things are, or what they may become is something our society does continuously – from recognizing our family member’s voice on the telephone to approving a loan application.  Computationally programming computers to help us make this style of prediction has theoretical underpinnings that are decades old, and more recently have become practical solutions to problems through the advancement in computer hardware
 

We’ll cover a 365° view of how computer scientists (or, engineers in general) choose and implement data focused algorithms, how to conduct experiments to compare the results of different algorithms, visualizing results, how to write code in a common data science computing platform, and what implications that data and algorithm selection has on society.

Learning Goals 
Practice cleaning and manipulating data 
Gain experience writing python code using common packages  
Develop an understanding of data mining algorithms 
Evaluate the performance of data mining algorithms 
Collaborate with your colleagues 
Navigate and understand technical documentation "
